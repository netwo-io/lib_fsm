== Finite State Machine (FSM) library for PostgreSQL (PL/pgSQL)

lib_fsm is not maintained anymore at Netwo but its maintainer continue to work on it [here](https://github.com/FGRibreau/lib_fsm/)


=== Features

[x] User-defined state support: let your user specify their own state machine while still ensuring consistency

[x] Multi-tenant: each row/column from your table can reference a state in another state machine

[x] Historical support: successful state changes are recorded

[x] Complete API

[x] Fully tested

[x] Visual graph generation

=== Convention

A finite state machine has `states`, `events` and `transitions`.

A state machine can go from one `state` to another `state` through a `transition`.
State change is triggered with an `event`.

A transition is a tuple of a start (previous) `state`, the `event` that will trigger the transition and a next `state`.

An `abstract state machine` describe a `state machine`, its `(abstract) state` and `(abstract) transition`.

A `state machine` is an instance of an `abstract state machine` and points to an `abstract state`, thus an `abstract state machine`.
A consistent naming convention is essential to build a futur-proof project.

[#_states]
====== `state` name

- must be a verb
- verb tense must be either at the simple past (+ed) or at present progressive (+ing)
- lower-case
- snake_case if multiple words (e.g. `locked_out`)

Examples: opened, loading, loaded, recorded, closed, locked, dumped, shipped, finished, running, failed, entered, enabled, disabled, approved, published, archived, activated, pending, pending_renewal, expired, ordered, canceled, returned, refunded, checked_out

[#_event]
====== `event` name

- should be a single word (use snake_case otherwise)
- must be a verb
- verb tense must be infinitive
- lower-case

Examples: start, open, close, lock, unlock, load, unload, dump, ship, fail, enter, enable, disable, run, return, order, cancel, refund, confirm


=== Usage
=== API
==== What was tried before current implementation

> Why did they do that?

> I would not have done this way

==== Try #1 Listen to every table column changes

A trigger on every tables that listen to the table state column and that have a custom type like `lib_fsm.state_machine` to know it must be monitored.

- Cons:
* Custom types in PostgreSQL requires a C extension
* C extensions are not supported in PostgreSQL managed environments

Rejected.

==== Try #2 Composite type

The previous idea but instead of a custom type, we rely on a composite type `(last_state, abstract_machine__id)`.

- Pros:
* Easier to maintain
* Does not need column names convention
- Cons:
* No foreign key on abstract_machine__id (ensure referential integrity with a trigger)
* No foreign key on abstract_machine\__id (ensuring referential integrity with a trigger would require a schema introspection to retrieve all columns of type lib_fsm.state_machine.abstract_machine\__id === old.abstract_machine__id)

Rejected.

==== Try #3 External table to store every states

Externalize each machine current states to an independent table.
Each state is linked to a finite state machine (see `abstract state machine`).

- Pros:
* The table schema explicitly states that one of more columns are each linked to their state machine
* Supports multiple state (e.g. a contract might two columns, a `signed_status` and a `writing_status`)
- Cons:
* Looking at a table, you don't know the value of the current state (e.g. a contract status attribute).
It requires an extra join.

[#_visual_graph_generation]
==== Visual documentation generator

```bash
PGPASSWORD=$USER_PASSWORD psql -qtAX  -U $USER --password -c "select lib_fsm.state_machine_get_mermaid('081d831f-8f88-4650-aebe-4360599d4bdc') as mermaid;"
```

=== Next steps

- [ ] add support for versioning
- [ ] add support for transition `properties`
- [ ] add support for transition `triggers`: 0-N triggers, what events should automatically trigger the transition
- [ ] add support for transition `conditions`: 0-N (cf: https://github.com/FGRibreau/ui-predicate/[ui-predicate]), requires implementing `lib_rule_engine` first
- [ ] add support for transition `pre_conditions`: 0-N, these pre-conditions are run before displaying available events from 'from_state'
post_actions (0-N, what to do once we switched to `to_state`) <= WONT_IMPLEMENT
